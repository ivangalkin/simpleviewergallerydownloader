= Introduction =

After you start downloader your have to fill out two mandatory fields:

  # URL of Gallery's XML description (don't forget leading 'http://')
  # Path to your local directory, where downloaded pictures will be stored in

After you entered both parameters you can click on download button.

= How to find XML address =

Usually you will find an URL to desired XML description opening the HTML source code of gallery's web page. Sooner or later anywhere you will see something like

{{{
	<div id="flashcontent">SimpleViewer requires Adobe Flash. <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer/">Get Adobe Flash.</a> If you have Flash installed, <a href="index.html?detectflash=false">click to view gallery</a>.</div>	
	<script type="text/javascript">
		var fo = new SWFObject("viewer.swf", "viewer", "100%", "100%", "7", "#333333");	
		fo.addVariable("preloaderColor", "0xffffff");
		fo.addVariable("xmlDataPath", "gallery.xml");	
		fo.addVariable( "langOpenImage", "Bild in neuem Fenster Ã¶ffnen" );
		fo.addVariable("langAbout", "Info");	
		fo.write("flashcontent");	
	</script>	
}}}

This snippet can be also placed in some HTML frame or included JavaScript. According to its URL and path of *xmlDataPath* variable you will build your address.

== Example ==

Assume you found an interesting gallery under http://www.topgallery.eu/heide/. Viewing the source code of its page you see the above mentioned script block. That means desired XML description of a gallery is stored under http://www.topgallery.eu/heide/gallery.xml.

= Known bugs and open features =

Sadly there is no official XML schema (XSD or DTD) published for !SimpleViewer, also there are several versions of formats, used for gallery's description. That's why only  version 1.9 (?) of !SimpleViewer is supported, but even it can cause parsing errors.

If there will be interested parties (and some free time) I will make the downloader more universal.
